# ngx-flex-layout

## This is an attempt to port @angular/flex-layout to provide support after EOL

The Angular team has decided to depricate the @angular/flex-layout library after v15.  It seems that this is going to cause issues for some people.
In order to try and alleviate these problems, this clone repo/lib was created. 

if you would like to contribute or help maintain please do so.

### Areas needing help:
1. Set up CI/CD pipelines in Github
2. Managing PRs (approvals, etc...)
3. fix/enhancements (as of this time I am not planning on adding enhancements or fixes. If you want to add enhancements/fixes submit a PR )

**NOTE: The Angular team no longer publishes new releases of this project. Please review [this blog post](https://blog.angular.io/modern-css-in-angular-layouts-4a259dca9127) 
for alternatives, and [this article](https://medium.com/@caerus.karu/farewell-flex-layout-aaa567023769) for the explanation and next steps.**
